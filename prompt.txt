I need to implement a web app that will teach 10-12 year old kids to multiply.

The app will allow the user to start a test of multiple multiplications of numbers between 2 and 12, excluding 10.


Key requirements:
1. DESIGN: Modern interface, minimalist, big fonts and buttons. 
2. User Experience: The focus should be on the inputs when the page loads, and pressing ENTER will submit and show next question.
3. The user will select between 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 questions and press Start (or hit ENTER). It will then start a timer (that will display on bottom of the screen). 
At the end it will stop the timer.
4. Track the time of each question. At the end, display total time, average time per question, correct/wrong answers. For each wrong answer, add 10 seconds to the timer.
5. Allow the user to restart after the trial ended, or to stop the current test to start a new one.

Please consider:
- Error handling
- Edge cases
- Performance optimization
- Best practices

Make sure the code will be easy to scale.


Please do not unnecessarily remove any comments or code.
Generate the code with clear comments explaining the logic.
